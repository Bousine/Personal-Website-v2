  firstp: "Hello visitor! My name is Asif Hasan. I am a senior in Computer Science B.S. at UB. I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh, and now in the United States to pursue higher education. Modern technology is totally ingrained in computer science, so the possibilities are endless when it comes to learning technologies in this field. My interest mainly lies in front-end development and graphic design. The journey so far has not been easy but it was definitely rewarding. Perhaps I will further pursue an M.S. in Computer Science after some time. For now, I only seek to be a competent software engineer.",
  secondp: "When it comes to my hobbies, I am mostly interested in video games and movies. They are obviously great sources of entertainment but the level of creativity depicted in video games and movies is honestly quite amazing and inspiring. I am also deeply invested in watching soccer. Otherwise, travelling abroad is what I would like to do more often. The world is a beautiful place waiting to be explored.",
  thirdp: "Also, don't forget to check out my projects!"
